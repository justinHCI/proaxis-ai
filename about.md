## Our Story

Proaxis AI was founded by leading experts in conversational AI research with ties to Dublin, Ireland's renowned HCI and UX research community. With deep roots in academic research and a commitment to translating cutting-edge science into practical solutions, our team brings together decades of experience in human-computer interaction, natural language processing, and conversational system design.

Founded in 2025 and incorporated in the United States, Proaxis AI bridges the gap between world-class research and industry applications. Our founders and team members maintain strong ties with University College Dublin, home to one of Europe's largest HCI research groups and the SFI ADAPT Centre for AI-driven content technologies.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to advance the field of conversational AI through rigorous research and thoughtful application. We believe that the most effective AI systems are those that truly understand human communication patterns, cultural contexts, and social dynamics. By combining our deep academic expertise with practical industry experience, we help organizations deploy conversational AI that is not only technically sophisticated but also human-centered and ethically responsible.

- **Research Excellence**: Grounding all our work in peer-reviewed research and scientific methodology
- **Human-Centered Design**: Putting user experience and human needs at the center of every AI system we create
- **Cross-Cultural Competence**: Designing AI systems that work effectively across diverse cultural and linguistic contexts
- **Ethical AI Development**: Committed to responsible AI development that considers societal impact and fairness

## Our Approach

We start from a standpoint of understanding people. From broad understandings of humans as communicators, to culturally specific norms and expectations, to the specific needs of our users, we imbue technology with deep insights into how people talk, write, and think.

### Research-Driven Solutions

Our research expertise spans user-studies, design science, qunatitative modelling, and situated qualitative analysis. We see research, design, development, and deployment as an iterative cycle and systematic scientific process.

### Human-Centered Design

The AI systems we design are fundamentally for people. This means both helping peoople accomplish their goals and promoting joy and flourishing in interactions with technology.

### Scalable Technology

Technology solutions confined to a lab or a demo provide limited value for humanity. We have deployed our technological solutions in real, scalable environments including schools, financial institutions, medical environments, commercial products and retail platforms.
